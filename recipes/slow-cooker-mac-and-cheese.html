        <h5>Step 1:</h5>
        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a

            cheese
            over pasta and stir.</p>

        <h5>Step 3:</h5>
        <p> Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 4:</h5>
        <p> Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 5:</h5>
        <p> Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 6:</h5>
        <p>Cook on Low for 3 hours.</p>
